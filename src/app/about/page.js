                        <p>
                            Across India, folk and tribal arts are admired, reused, and commercialised, yet the artists behind them continue to remain unseen. Designs travel far, stories are packaged beautifully, but the hands that create them often stay where they began — on the margins.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            India carries one of the richest artistic heritages in the world. Every region speaks its own language of craft. Yet with time, respect for these art forms is fading as western aesthetics are placed above indigenous identity.

                        <p>
                            Costerbox was created to correct this imbalance. Here, artists are not vendors or suppliers. They are partners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The people associated with Costerbox are women balancing households while completing embroidery orders, widows reclaiming independence through skill, and gender minorities earning with dignity.

                        <p>
                            Work is flexible, respect is constant, and growth is shared. We believe that if a brand grows while its artists remain behind, the brand has failed.

                            Sumit and Sukhdev met unexpectedly, but their observations were identical.
                            Both had noticed the same gap: art being celebrated, artists being forgotten.

                                    A graduate of SMS Medical College, Sumit’s move into fashion was driven by discomfort. Observing the ecosystem, he noticed that while art was celebrated, the artists struggled.

                                    At Costerbox, his approach is clear: execution begins with the artist, not the product. Growth is meaningful only when it is shared.

                                    Hailing from western Rajasthan, with deep roots in Barmer and Jodhpur, Sukhdev witnessed the quiet injustice of artists lacking security.
